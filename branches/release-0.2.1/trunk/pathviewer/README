=== About Pathviewer ===

Pathviewer provides a graphical interface to viewing the results of path 
discovery and validation, as provided by Pathfinder.

=== Building Pathviewer ===

Pathfinder uses the CMake build environment, which is analagous to the standard
autoconf/automake system. Building proceeds in two steps:

First, run "cmake .". This will create a set of makefiles which enables you to
actually build pathfinder (this is analagous to running "./configure" with an 
AutoConf-based system). 

Next, run "make". This will actually build the executables and libraries that
form Pathfinder.

To install Pathfinder, run "make install". This will install all files needed
to use Pathfinder into "/usr/local". If you wish to install Pathfinder into a
different prefix, you must specify this at configure time:

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<my preferred prefix> .

For example, running cmake as follows would build and install everything into 
/home/wlach/tmp:

cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/wlach/tmp .
make install

Pathfinder depends on the following libraries: D-Bus (to interface with 
Pathfinder), libpathfinder-nss (for the validation method), and gtk+/libglade 
(for the widgets).

=== Using Pathviewer ===

Simply run the pathviewer executable, and load the der encoded certificate of 
your choice. Pathviewer will automatically attempt to connect to the pathfinder
daemon and validate the certificate. You may reconfigure the pathfinder daemon
while pathviewer is running: simply click on "refresh" if you wish to validate
a certificate a second time.
